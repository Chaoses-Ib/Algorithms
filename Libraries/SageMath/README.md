## Comparisons
- Sage is free and open-source.
- Sage uses Python, while MATLAB, Mathematica and Maple use their proprietary languages.
- > In certain areas of mathematics such as Number Theory and Group Theory, Sageâ€™s core capabilities greatly exceed those of Mathematica, to the best of my knowledge.[^cmp-quora-2019]
- Sage has a low priority for Windows support.
- > Sage + Jupyter does not provide typesetting capabilities of Mathematica notebooks, i.e., write formulas naturally, with all subscripts and superscripts.[^cmp-quora-2019]
- Sage has lower performance than MATLAB.
