## Linear chains
A **linear chain** is a tree where the number of children of each parent is at most one.

## Implementations
Rust:
- [nary-tree: A vec-backed tree structure with tree-specific generational indexes.](https://github.com/osimarr/nary-tree)
- [ego-tree: Vec-backed ID-tree](https://github.com/causal-agent/ego-tree)
- [id-tree: A library for creating and modifying Tree structures.](https://github.com/iwburns/id-tree) (discontinued)
